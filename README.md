# PTS course
---
This is a repo I created for organizing the code and writeups for the PTS(Penetration Testing Student) labs.        

My notes are on [OneNote](https://iiitdmacin-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/ced19i002_iiitdm_ac_in/EoNBXRhPFkZPkoOAnPFig8wB3InruCZmWYe8Go745N7SIw?e=Cmfhvn) if you want to check them out. Organizing them on one-note was easier than writing them in MD.   

I may have left out somethings in the notes because I've already learnt that stuff in my university courses or before taking this course, So do not use my notes as a reference learning material.
